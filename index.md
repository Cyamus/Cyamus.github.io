<i class='fa fa-magic'></i> **Cyamus Trading** ("**Cyamus**") is founded in 2019 by [Terry Li](https://bit.ly/terryli) (ex-VP of [796 Exchange](https://www.796.com), ex-CEO of [TDEx](https://www.tdex.com), and a license distributor of [Trading System Lab](https://www.tradingsystemlab.com) for the greater China region). Cyamus offers systematic trading and data analysis services to institutional clients who actively [seek <i class='fa fa-volume-up'></i> asymmetric returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_payoff).

We started developing algorithmic trading systems on MetaTrader 4 (MT4) in October 2015 and we moved onto developing a more advanced system on Dukascopy JForex in May 2016. Our trading system development has come on in leaps and bounds ever since. All Cyamus trading systems are developed based on a single cohesive proprietary principle that has evolved to its second (2nd) generation in February 2019 and third (3rd) generation in November 2019. It encompasses proven trading ideologies, such as diversification through uncorrelated instruments and money management. We believe that its robust performance on multiple markets at all historically-tested semiannual timeframes can substantiate its universality.

All trading system performances falter from time to time. In general, investors are willing to endure as long as the stagnations are worthwhile; meaning, a short stagnant period and a drawdown on equity comparatively small to the upside potential that comes after the stagnant period. Cyamus develops mid-frequency trading systems, which have semiannual [time-horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_horizon). All of our trading systems have **Annualized [Risk Return Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_return_ratio)** ([CAGR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) / [MDD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)) higher than 6, and **Quarterly Annualized** ones higher than 0.5. Therefore, one can expect that a three-month time is how long the [AUM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) of Cyamus takes to eclipse its prior [high-water mark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/highwatermark.asp) and that one-year time to see satisfactory [RORAC](investopedia.com/terms/r/raroc.asp).

In February 2019, we launched our own systems and started issuing *LIVE* trading signals to a few accounts belonging to our friends and family. We do not use the [two and twenty ("2 and 20") fee arrangement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two_and_twenty.asp). Ours is "0 and X". That is, clients paying agreed X only if our trading system performs as expected based on the [high-water mark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/highwatermark.asp) and [hurdle rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp) principles.

Although Cyamus trading system is universal enough to trade in all markets, We focus on financial instruments that offer the highest [spread-to-pip potential](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/spread-pip-potential-pairs-day-trading.asp). We develop trading systems to trade the instruments that belong to these three categories: 1) **Japanese Yen Pairs**; 2) **Stock Index Pairs**; and 3) **Crypto Pairs**. The strategies that trade on the *Japanese Yen Pairs* and *Stock Index Pairs* have gone *LIVE*, trading real money since February 2019; and the one that trade on the *Crypto Pairs* is still being tested in-house sooner become available for invited clients to trade *LIVE*:

1. **Japanese Yen Pairs** (*LIVE*)
    - US Dollar to Japanese Yen
      - *USD/JPY*
    - Euro Dollar to Japanese Yen
      - *EUR/JPY*
    - Great British Pound to Japanese Yen
      - *GBP/JPY*
2. **Stock Index Pairs** (*LIVE*)
    - US Dow Jones Industrial Average
      - *USA30.IDX/USD*
    - Germany DAX 30 Stock Market Index
      - *DEU.IDX/EUR*
3. **Crypto Pairs** (*Testing...*)
    - Bitcoin
      - *BTC/USD*
    - Ether
      - *ETH/USD*

<i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System** is historically back-tested since the year 2004 based on bid-n-ask tick data provided by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank). Forex brokerage industry is trending toward offering higher and higher [leverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forexleverage.asp), sometimes up to 200:1 but the entry signaled by Cyamus Yen Trading System *have never* exceeded **7.42:1**. Therefore, our clients can take comfort in knowing that most of the forex brokers that they have been using for years are most likely to be compatible with Cyamus Yen Trading System.

<i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System** is historically back-tested since the year 2014 based on bid-n-ask tick data provided by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank). The [leverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forexleverage.asp) used by Cyamus Index Trading System *have never* exceeded **14.35:1**，which is well below 50:1 (weekday) and 30:1 (weekend) offered by Dukascopy Bank on CFD trading instruments.

Note that <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System** and <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System** take on new position as market opportunity presents itself, i.e. decision making process of opening a new position does not take existing position(s) into consideration. Therefore, position [scaling](https://learn.tradimo.com/dont-go-broke-protect-your-capital/scaling-in-and-out-of-trades) and [hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/forex/forex-hedge-and-currency-hedging-strategy.asp) may happen but they are not inherit part of the trading system. Moreover, one should also note that **Cyamus Yen Trading System** was backtested on sixteen (16) years of [bid-n-ask tick data provided by Dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/), the longest period of sample data among the three (3) trading systems. In theory, the data reflects more varied market conditions than those used by **Cyamus Index Trading System** and **Cyamus Crypto System** which only used six (6) and three (3) years of sample data sets respectively.

### <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Rolling Window Analysis

The following [FundSeeder](https://fundseeder.com/) charts display the <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> [rolling-window analysis](https://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/rolling-window-estimation-of-state-space-models.html) of the combined performance of **Cyamus Index Trading System** and **Cyamus Yen Trading System** of the last five (5) years in terms of:

1. Return on equity
2. Sharpe ratio
3. Sortino ratio/√2
4. Correlation

#### 1. <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Equity Return

**Return on Equity (Three-Month <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Rolling Window)** consistently beats benchmarks, such as SG CTA Index, maintained well above 3.96% and reached as high as 59.20%.

[![Return (Three-Month Rolling Window)](/img_pr/return_20200822145552.png)](/img_pr/return_20200822145552.png)

#### 2. <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Sharpe Ratio

**Sharpe Ratio (Three-Month <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Rolling Window)** consistently beats benchmarks, such as SG CTA Index, maintained well above 1.14 and reached as high as 25.

[![Sharpe Ratio (Three-Month Rolling Window)](/img_pr/pm_20200822130602.png)](/img_pr/pm_20200822130602.png)

#### 3. <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Sortino Ratio/√2

[According to FundSeeder](https://fundseeder.com/FundSeeder%20Analytics%20Manual.pdf), *Sortino Ratio/√2* allows for comparing the Sortino ratio to the Sharpe ratio. They multiply the risk measure of the Sortino ratio by the square root of 2 (which is the same as dividing the Sortino ratio by the square root of 2).  Their adjusted version of the Sortino ratio allows for direct comparisons of the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. Generally speaking, a higher adjusted Sortino ratio implies that the distribution of returns is right-skewed (a greater tendency for large gains than large losses). And, similarly, a lower adjusted Sortino ratio implies returns are left-skewed (a greater propensity for large losses than large gains). **Sortino Ratio/√2 (Three-Month <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Rolling Window)** consistently beats benchmarks, such as SG CTA Index, maintained well above 1.95 and reached as high as 97.49.

[![Sortino Ratio/√2 (Three-Month Rolling Window)](/img_pr/sortino_20200822141818.png)](/img_pr/sortino_20200822141818.png)

#### 4. <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Correlation

**Correlation (Three-Month <i class='fa fa-window-restore'></i> Rolling Window)** exhibits low correlation with CTA and stocks so that Cyamus systems can add significant diversification benefits to your existing portfolio.

## <i class='fa fa-bar-chart'></i> By Quant Analyzer

The following [Quant Anlayzer](https://strategyquant.com/quantanalyzer) charts summarize the major performance measures of the *individual performance* of <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System** since January 2004 and <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System** since January 2014.

The earliest trading system that we developed is on *Japanese Yen Pairs* (<b>USDJPY</b>, <b>EURJPY</b> and <b>GBPJPY</b>) are <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System**. The other trading system that Cyamus developed is on two (2) stock index pairs: <b>USA30.IDX/USD</b> and <b>DEU.IDX/EUR</b>. They have been traded *LIVE* since Feb 2019 on [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank).

Historical backtesting reports of the two trading systems are presented below. They share the same position entry setup and exit. They are simply constructed based on different position sizing techniques so that you can have a clearer picture of how the trading systems perform.

- **[Maximum Drawdown (MDD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)** and **Annualized [Risk Return Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_return_ratio)** will help you work out your [risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp) allocation on a time horizon scale.
- **R-Expectancy** = Net Profit of All Trades ÷ Total Number of Trades ÷ Average Loss per Losing Trade = Average Profitability per Trade (APPT) ÷ Average Loss per Losing Trade (R). It will help you evaluate reward-to-risk ratio on a per trade level. In other words, it gives you an idea of the return that you can expect from our trading systems on the average per dollar risked.

### <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> Dynamic Lot

Dynamic Lot as a position sizing technique helps you understand how your investment may grow in time in percentage terms, effectively eliminating the factor of risk capital allocation. That is, no matter how much money you allocate to trade the systems initially, the performance measures can still be applicable because all new positions are dynamically sized based on **current account balance** (**CAB**) at time of opening a new position and **[maximum drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)** (**MDD**).

- <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System**
  - Newly established position size equals to **0.01 x 10% x CAB/MDD**, where the 0.01 is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank), the 10% is the controlling factor for **[risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp)**, and the **MDD** is **-7.36%** based on 2004 to July 2020 historical performance data.
- <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System**:
  - Newly established position size equal to **0.1 x 10% x CAB/MDD**, where the 0.1 is the minimum transaction size on stock index pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank), the 10% is the controlling factor for **[risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp)**, and the **MDD** is **-10.30%** based on 2014 to July 2020 historical performance data.

### <i class='fa fa-cog'></i> Fixed Lot

Fixed Lot as a position sizing technique allows us to give you a fair and reasonable presentation of the **R-Expectancy**. It will help you evaluate reward-to-risk ratio on a per trade level. In other words, it gives you an idea of what to expect from our trading systems on the average (i.e. per dollar risked).

- All new position sizes are the same.
- <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System**
  - All positions are opened with **0.01** [standard lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-lot.asp), which is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank) on forex currency pairs.
- <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System**
  - All positions are opened with **0.1** [standard lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-lot.asp), which is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank) on stock index [CFD](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp)s.

{: .box-note}
Throughout this page, we will continue to use <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> to denote <b>Dynamic Lot</b>; and to use <i class='fa fa-cog'></i> to denote <b>Fixed Lot</b> for clarity and shortness.

All the numbers presented below have factored in the negative impact of the transaction costs, such as spread, commissions and broker interest charges. In other words, you would have experienced the same results if you manage to travel back in time to trade <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System** and <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System** *LIVE*. You can also click on the <i class='fa fa-line-chart'></i> link to visually examine the equity growth of the trading system; and click on the <i class='fa fa-calendar'></i> link to see the month-to-month equity growth in <i class='fa fa-percent'></i> percentage in the <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> model or in <i class='fa fa-dollar'></i> dollar in the <i class='fa fa-cog'></i> model.
