## <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> 日元貨幣對<br>JPY-Pairs

The earliest strategy that Cyamus developed is on three (3) Japanese Yen pairs: <b>USDJPY</b>, <b>EURJPY</b> and <b>GBPJPY</b>. It has been traded *LIVE* since Feb 2019 on [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank). Two (2) sets of reports are presented below based on different account position sizing techniques:

- <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> <b>fixed percentage</b>;
- <i class='fa fa-cog'></i> <b>fixed lot</b>
  - 0.01 lot for JPY Pairs
  - 0.1 lot for Stock Index Pairs



### <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> | <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> 按倉位比例大小建倉<br>Fixed Percentage

In the following reports, fixed percentage is used as the position sizing technique. All new positions are sized based on **current account balance** (**CAB**) at time of opening a new position and **[maximum drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)** (**MDD**). The size of new position is equal to **0.01 * 10% * CAB/MDD**, where the 0.01 is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank), the 10% is the controlling factor for **[risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp)**, and the **MDD** is **-7.36%** based on 2004 to July 2020 historical performance data.

Position [scaling](https://learn.tradimo.com/dont-go-broke-protect-your-capital/scaling-in-and-out-of-trades) and [hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/forex/forex-hedge-and-currency-hedging-strategy.asp) may happen on an instrument but do not mistaken them as part of the strategy. The strategy merely takes on new position as market opportunity presents itself, i.e. decision making process of opening a new position does not take existing position(s) into consideration.

The historical strategy performance report is broken down in year as follows:

## <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> 股票指數對<br>Stock Index Pairs

The second strategy that Cyamus developed is on two (2) stock index pairs: <b>USA30.IDX/USD</b> and <b>DEU.IDX/EUR</b>. It has been traded *LIVE* since Feb 2019 on [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank). Two (2) sets of reports are presented below based on different account position sizing techniques: 1. fixed lot; and 2. fixed percentage.

### <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> | <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> 按倉位比例大小建倉<br>Fixed Percentage

In the following reports, fixed percentage is used as the position sizing technique. All new positions are sized based on **current account balance** (**CAB**) at time of opening a new position and **[maximum drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)** (**MDD**). The size of new position is equal to **0.1 * 10% * CAB/MDD**, where the 0.1 is the minimum transaction size on stock index pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank), the 10% is the controlling factor for **[risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp)**, and the **MDD** is **-10.30%** based on 2014 to July 2020 historical performance data.

Position [scaling](https://learn.tradimo.com/dont-go-broke-protect-your-capital/scaling-in-and-out-of-trades) and [hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/forex/forex-hedge-and-currency-hedging-strategy.asp) may happen on an instrument but do not mistaken them as part of the strategy.
